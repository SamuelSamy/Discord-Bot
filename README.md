# Discord Bot

A general purpose discord bot used in servers I manage (`Anime Fighters` discord.gg/animefighters, `Bura` link_TBA)

The bot has a lot of features, but the most important ones are detecting scam messages (Dscord has problem with dealing with the hacked accounts that spam "free discord nitro" scams, I decided to create a module to reduce the amount of scam messages) and a ban appeal system which is easy to use and manage.
